## Why
We need a core markdown editing capability to serve as the foundation for our Typora-inspired application. This will provide the essential functionality for users to create, edit, and format markdown documents with a modern, intuitive interface.

## What Changes
- **ADDED**: Core markdown editor component with live preview
- **ADDED**: Basic markdown syntax support (headers, bold, italic, lists, links)
- **ADDED**: File operations (open, save, new document)
- **ADDED**: Real-time preview pane
- **ADDED**: Basic keyboard shortcuts for common operations

## Impact
- Affected specs: `core` capability (new)
- Affected code: New editor component, preview system, file handling
- Dependencies: Markdown parsing library, file system APIs
