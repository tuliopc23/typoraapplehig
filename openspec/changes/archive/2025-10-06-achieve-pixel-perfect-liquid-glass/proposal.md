# Achieve 100% Pixel-Perfect Apple Liquid Glass Design Compliance

## Why

The current theme achieves 100% compliance with basic Apple HIG specifications (confirmed by validation), but lacks the **post-WWDC 2025 design language** introduced in macOS Tahoe and iOS 26. The new **Liquid Glass** design system represents Apple's evolution toward a more dynamic, translucent, and refined visual language that adapts to content and context.

**Current Limitations:**
- ‚ùå Light mode is NOT implemented (only dark mode variables exist)
- ‚ùå No Liquid Glass material effects (blur, translucency, depth)
- ‚ùå Missing rounded corners that match modern Apple hardware
- ‚ùå Outdated color values (not aligned with macOS Tahoe/iOS 26)
- ‚ùå No vibrancy or material layering
- ‚ùå Missing micro-interactions and polish details
- ‚ùå Incomplete Typora-specific feature support (alerts, diagrams, math, etc.)
- ‚ùå No card/panel components with proper elevation
- ‚ùå Missing adaptive spacing and responsive refinements

**Opportunity:**
Create the definitive Apple-themed Typora experience that feels indistinguishable from a native macOS app, leveraging all 2025 design innovations while supporting the full breadth of Typora's markdown features.

## Notes

This is not an incremental update‚Äîit's a complete reimagining of what a Typora theme can be. The goal is to create the definitive reference implementation for Apple design system compliance in a third-party application, setting a new standard for design excellence in markdown editors.

The validation script already confirms 100% compliance with basic HIG specs. This proposal takes us from "compliant" to "indistinguishable from Apple."
