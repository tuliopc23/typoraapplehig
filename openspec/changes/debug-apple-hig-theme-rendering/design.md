# Debug Apple HIG Theme Rendering - Technical Design

## Context

The Apple HIG theme for Typora is experiencing rendering issues that prevent it from displaying correctly. The theme has a comprehensive design system with proper Apple HIG compliance, but fundamental technical issues are preventing proper rendering in Typora's environment.

## Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals
- Fix all theme rendering issues to enable proper display in Typora
- Maintain Apple HIG compliance while ensuring Typora compatibility
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility and reliability
- Provide working foundation for future theme improvements

### Non-Goals
- Major redesign of the theme's visual appearance
- Adding new features beyond fixing rendering issues
- Supporting unsupported Typora versions
- Maintaining compatibility with other markdown editors

## Decisions

### Decision: Systematic Debugging Approach
**What**: Use a systematic, step-by-step debugging approach starting with fundamental issues and progressing to more complex problems.

**Why**: Theme rendering issues can have multiple root causes, and a systematic approach ensures we identify and fix all problems without missing critical issues.

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Random debugging approach (rejected - too inefficient)
- Complete rewrite (rejected - unnecessary given good foundation)

### Decision: Typora-Specific CSS Targeting
**What**: Focus on ensuring CSS selectors properly target Typora's actual DOM structure and markdown rendering elements.

**Why**: Typora has specific DOM structure and CSS class naming conventions that may differ from standard markdown renderers.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Generic markdown CSS approach (rejected - won't work with Typora)
- Browser-only CSS approach (rejected - Typora has specific requirements)

### Decision: Font Loading Debugging Priority
**What**: Prioritize debugging font loading issues as they can prevent the entire theme from rendering correctly.

**Why**: Font loading issues are often the root cause of theme rendering problems and can cascade to other visual issues.

**Alternatives considered**:
- CSS debugging first (rejected - fonts are fundamental)
- Visual debugging first (rejected - fonts affect all visual elements)

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Risk: Breaking Changes During Debugging
**Mitigation**: Create comprehensive backups before making changes and test each fix incrementally.

### Risk: Platform-Specific Issues
**Mitigation**: Test on multiple platforms and operating systems throughout the debugging process.

### Risk: Typora Version Compatibility
**Mitigation**: Test with multiple Typora versions and document compatibility requirements.

### Risk: Performance Impact
**Mitigation**: Monitor performance during debugging and optimize as needed.

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis and Setup
1. Create test environment with comprehensive markdown content
2. Set up debugging tools and capture current state
3. Document all current issues and their symptoms

### Phase 2: Fundamental Fixes
1. Fix font loading and path issues
2. Debug CSS selector targeting
3. Fix CSS syntax and compatibility issues

### Phase 3: Visual Debugging
1. Fix visual rendering issues
2. Debug glass material effects
3. Test responsive design

### Phase 4: Cross-Platform Testing
1. Test on all supported platforms
2. Fix platform-specific issues
3. Validate compatibility

### Phase 5: Final Validation
1. Comprehensive testing
2. Performance optimization
3. Documentation and deployment

## Open Questions

- What specific Typora version should be the primary target for compatibility?
- Are there any specific Typora features that should be prioritized for testing?
- What is the expected timeline for completing the debugging process?
- Are there any specific user workflows that should be tested?
