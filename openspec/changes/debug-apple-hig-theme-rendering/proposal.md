# Debug Apple HIG Theme Rendering Issues

## Why

The Apple HIG theme is not rendering properly in Typora, preventing users from experiencing the intended 100% Apple Human Interface Guidelines compliant design. After comprehensive analysis of the Typora custom theme guide, Apple HIG documentation, and current theme implementation, several critical issues have been identified that are preventing proper theme rendering and functionality.

The theme appears to have a solid foundation with proper design tokens and Apple HIG compliance, but fundamental rendering issues are preventing it from displaying correctly in Typora, making it unusable for its intended purpose.

- Update selectors to target correct Typora elements (#write, .md-*, etc.)
- Fix any CSS specificity issues preventing styles from applying
- Ensure proper targeting of Typora's markdown rendering elements

### CSS Variable and Compatibility Issues
- Debug CSS custom property support and fallbacks for older Typora versions
