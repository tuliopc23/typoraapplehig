# Technical Design for Typora HIG Compliance Refactoring

## Context

The current Apple HIG Typora theme implements a sophisticated design system with liquid glass effects and modern CSS architecture. However, precise compliance with Apple's Human Interface Guidelines requires systematic refinement of typography, colors, components, and interactions to match Apple's exact specifications.

This refactoring maintains the existing architecture while enhancing precision and compliance without breaking Typora's core functionality.

## Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals
- Achieve 100% compliance with Apple HIG specifications for macOS
- Maintain existing liquid glass aesthetic and modern design system
- Preserve all current Markdown functionality and Typora compatibility
- Improve accessibility and usability through better Apple design patterns
- Create a reference implementation for Apple HIG compliance in web contexts

### Non-Goals
- Changing the fundamental architecture or design token system
- Breaking compatibility with existing Typora installations
- Removing liquid glass effects or modern visual enhancements
- Supporting non-Apple design systems or alternative aesthetics

## Technical Decisions

### Typography System Architecture

**Decision**: Implement exact Apple HIG typography specifications using CSS custom properties
- Use Apple's exact font sizes from HIG documentation (11pt, 12pt, 13pt, 15pt, 17pt, 20pt, 22pt, 28pt, 34pt)
- Implement precise tracking values from Apple's tracking tables
- Map semantic typography styles to exact Apple text styles (Large Title, Title 1-3, Headline, Body, etc.)

**Rationale**: Apple's typography system is precisely defined with specific sizes, weights, and spacing that create optimal readability and hierarchy. Approximations reduce authenticity and accessibility.

**Implementation**: Update design tokens with exact values, maintain fallback system for browser compatibility.

### Color System Precision

**Decision**: Replace current color approximations with exact Apple system colors
- Implement precise RGB values from Apple's design resources
- Use semantic color naming that matches Apple's color system
- Maintain dark mode variants with exact Apple dark mode colors

**Rationale**: Color precision is critical for authentic Apple design language and proper accessibility compliance. Apple's colors are scientifically designed for optimal contrast and usability.

**Implementation**: Update CSS custom properties with exact hex/RGB values, maintain semantic naming convention.

### Component Design Patterns

**Decision**: Refactor components to match Apple's HIG component specifications
- Lists: Implement Apple's list styling with proper bullets, spacing, and hierarchy
- Tables: Use Apple's table design patterns with proper headers and row styling
- Boxes: Follow Apple's container design principles for content grouping
- Interactive elements: Match Apple's interaction patterns and feedback

**Rationale**: Component consistency with Apple's design language improves usability and creates familiar interaction patterns for users.

**Implementation**: Systematic refactoring of component styles while maintaining Typora's Markdown rendering requirements.

### Layout and Spacing System

**Decision**: Enforce strict 8pt grid compliance across all elements
- Audit all spacing values against Apple's 8pt grid system
- Implement consistent vertical rhythm based on Apple's typography specifications
- Use Apple's recommended content widths and responsive breakpoints

**Rationale**: Apple's 8pt grid system creates visual harmony and consistency that improves readability and aesthetic appeal.

**Implementation**: Update spacing tokens and component margins/padding to align with 8pt increments.

### Glass Material System Enhancement

**Decision**: Refine glass effects to better match Apple's material design
- Update opacity, blur, and saturation values for more authentic glass appearance
- Improve fallback styles for better cross-browser compatibility
- Optimize performance while maintaining visual quality

**Rationale**: The liquid glass aesthetic should complement, not compete with, Apple's design language. Refinement improves authenticity without sacrificing the modern visual appeal.

**Implementation**: Adjust CSS backdrop-filter properties and fallback styles.

## Architecture Decisions

### Design Token Structure
- **Maintain**: Current primitive/semantic token architecture
- **Enhance**: Add Apple HIG reference comments for traceability
- **Refine**: Update values for exact Apple compliance

### CSS Organization
- **Maintain**: Current section-based organization
- **Enhance**: Add HIG compliance mapping in comments
- **Improve**: Better documentation of design decisions

### Responsive Strategy
- **Maintain**: Current mobile-first responsive approach
- **Enhance**: Better alignment with Apple's adaptive design principles
- **Optimize**: Improved performance on mobile devices

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Visual Changes Risk
- **Risk**: Users may notice visual differences in typography and spacing
- **Mitigation**: Changes improve readability and follow established design principles
- **Trade-off**: Short-term adjustment period for long-term design quality improvement

### Performance Considerations
- **Risk**: More precise calculations might impact rendering performance
- **Mitigation**: Optimize CSS for performance, maintain efficient selectors
- **Trade-off**: Minimal performance impact for significant design quality improvement

### Browser Compatibility
- **Risk**: Advanced CSS features may not work in older browsers
- **Mitigation**: Maintain robust fallback systems
- **Trade-off**: Progressive enhancement approach ensures basic functionality everywhere

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Typography and Color Updates
1. Update design tokens with exact Apple specifications
2. Test typography rendering across different content types
3. Validate color contrast and accessibility compliance

### Phase 2: Component Refinement
1. Refactor lists, tables, and interactive elements
2. Test component behavior with various Markdown content
3. Validate responsive behavior across devices

### Phase 3: Polish and Optimization
1. Refine glass effects and visual details
2. Optimize performance and cross-browser compatibility
3. Final testing and documentation updates

### Rollback Strategy
- Maintain current theme file as backup
- Document all changes for easy reversal if needed
- Provide migration notes for users

## Open Questions

1. **Typography Scaling**: Should we implement Dynamic Type simulation for better accessibility?
   - **Decision**: Yes, implement basic scaling support while maintaining design integrity

2. **Glass Effect Intensity**: Should glass effects be more subtle to better match Apple's current design direction?
   - **Decision**: Refine for authenticity while maintaining visual appeal

3. **Component Variants**: Should we add support for different component variants (e.g., compact lists)?
   - **Decision**: Focus on primary variants first, consider extensions in future iterations

4. **Performance Optimization**: What level of performance optimization is needed for mobile devices?
   - **Decision**: Implement reduced glass effects on mobile while maintaining visual quality
