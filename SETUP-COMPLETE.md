# Setup Complete! 🎉

## What We Just Did

### 1. ✅ Populated Project Context
**File**: `openspec/project.md`

Your project context is now fully documented with:
- **Purpose**: Apple HIG-compliant themes for markdown editors (Typora → iA Writer)
- **Tech Stack**: CSS3, San Francisco fonts, design tokens, accessibility features
- **Conventions**: 
  - Three-layer design token system (primitive → semantic → component)
  - Single-file architecture for Typora
  - Apple's 8pt grid system
  - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Constraints**: 
  - Must maintain 100% Apple HIG compliance
  - No JavaScript (pure CSS/HTML)
  - Offline-capable (embedded fonts)
- **Dependencies**: SF Pro Display, SF Pro Text, SF Mono fonts

### 2. ✅ Created Change Proposal: `add-iawriter-template`
**Location**: `openspec/changes/add-iawriter-template/`

This proposal includes:

#### **proposal.md** - The Why and What
- **Why**: Expand from Typora-only to support iA Writer users
- **What**: Convert theme to iA Writer's bundle format (.iatemplate)
- **Impact**: New capability, no breaking changes, parallel implementation

#### **tasks.md** - Implementation Checklist (60 tasks)
Organized into 11 major sections:
1. Research & Setup (5 tasks) - ✅ 1 completed (fetched iA Writer guide)
2. Template Bundle Structure (4 tasks)
3. HTML Templates (18 tasks)
4. CSS Conversion (23 tasks)
5. Font Integration (4 tasks)
6. Dark Mode Support (4 tasks)
7. Accessibility Features (5 tasks)
8. Testing (10 tasks)
9. Documentation (6 tasks)
10. Quality Assurance (8 tasks)
11. Release Preparation (5 tasks)

#### **design.md** - Technical Decisions
Key design decisions documented:
- **Bundle structure**: Standard .iatemplate format with embedded fonts
- **Content sizing**: Map iA Writer's 7 sizes to Apple HIG proportionally
- **Token organization**: Reuse three-layer system from Typora theme
- **HTML structure**: Semantic HTML5 with proper ARIA landmarks
- **Font loading**: Embedded with relative paths
- **Responsive**: Mobile (< 768px), Tablet (768-1024px), Desktop (> 1024px)
- **Dark mode**: Automatic via `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`

Includes risk mitigation and open questions to explore.

#### **specs/iawriter-templates/spec.md** - Complete Requirements
10 major requirements with 33 scenarios:
1. Template Bundle Structure (3 scenarios)
2. Content Size Support (3 scenarios)
3. HTML Template Structure (3 scenarios)
4. CSS Styling Compliance (3 scenarios)
5. Dark Mode Adaptation (2 scenarios)
6. Responsive Layout (3 scenarios)
7. Accessibility Features (4 scenarios)
8. Export Compatibility (3 scenarios)
9. Installation and Usage (3 scenarios)
10. Design Consistency (4 scenarios)

All requirements follow OpenSpec format with testable scenarios.

### 3. ✅ Validated Proposal
**Status**: ✅ Valid (passes strict validation)
```bash
openspec validate add-iawriter-template --strict
# Result: Change 'add-iawriter-template' is valid
```

### 4. ✅ Created Workflow Guide
**File**: `OPENSPEC-WORKFLOW.md`

Comprehensive guide explaining:
- The three-stage workflow (Creating → Implementing → Archiving)
- When to create proposals vs direct fixes
- How to write spec deltas
- Common commands and troubleshooting
- Best practices for your project
- Complete example of creating a new change

## What You Need to Know

### The OpenSpec Three-Stage Workflow

**Stage 1: Creating Changes (Planning)** 👈 We just did this!
- Created proposal before any code
- Documented requirements with testable scenarios
- Made technical decisions explicit
- Validated the proposal structure

**Stage 2: Implementing Changes (Development)** 👈 Next step!
- Work through tasks.md sequentially
- Mark tasks complete as you finish them
- Test thoroughly at each stage
- Update documentation as needed

**Stage 3: Archiving Changes (After Deployment)**
- Move to archive folder with date prefix
- Update specs to reflect new capabilities
- Document what was actually built

### Key Commands You'll Use

```bash
# View your active change
openspec show add-iawriter-template

# See the differences it will introduce
openspec diff add-iawriter-template

# List all changes and specs
openspec list
openspec list --specs

# Validate before committing
openspec validate add-iawriter-template --strict

# After implementation and deployment
openspec archive add-iawriter-template
```

### Your Change Status
```
Changes:
  add-iawriter-template     1/60 tasks ✅
```

One task is already marked complete (fetching the iA Writer guide), with 59 remaining for implementation.

## Next Steps

### 1. Review the Proposal
Read through all files in `openspec/changes/add-iawriter-template/`:
- Start with `proposal.md` to understand the high-level goals
- Review `design.md` for technical decisions
- Read `specs/iawriter-templates/spec.md` for complete requirements
- Scan `tasks.md` to understand the implementation scope

### 2. Request Approval (Optional)
If you're working with a team or want feedback:
- Share the proposal files
- Discuss technical decisions in design.md
- Adjust based on feedback
- Re-validate after changes

### 3. Start Implementation
Once ready to build:
```bash
# Open the tasks file
open openspec/changes/add-iawriter-template/tasks.md

# Start with section 2 (Setup is done)
# Work through tasks sequentially
# Mark each task as [x] when complete
```

### 4. Implementation Tips
- **Research first**: Complete section 2 (review iA Writer examples)
- **Build incrementally**: Don't skip to complex parts
- **Test frequently**: Validate in iA Writer as you build
- **Stay minimal**: Make the smallest changes that work
- **Reference specs**: Check `specs/iawriter-templates/spec.md` for requirements

### 5. After Completion
- Test thoroughly (section 8)
- Update documentation (section 9)
- Run quality assurance (section 10)
- Prepare release (section 11)
- Archive the change: `openspec archive add-iawriter-template`

## Quick Reference

### OpenSpec Philosophy
> **Specs are truth. Changes are proposals. Keep them in sync.**

### When to Create Proposals
✅ New features, breaking changes, architecture changes, performance work
❌ Bug fixes, typos, config changes, non-breaking updates

### Proposal Structure
```
changes/[change-id]/
├── proposal.md         # Why and what
├── tasks.md           # Implementation checklist

└── specs/             # Requirements with scenarios
    └── [capability]/
